# The Enclosure Projects

This site has jupyter notebooks with code and mathematical appendices to reproduce content for the paper:

>Baker, Matthew J. and Jonathan Conning (2021) [A Model of Enclosures: Efficiency, Coordination, and Conflict in the Transformation of Land Property Rights](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1yhsnk94RIJL5HRMQLJy5nqQD-rApiVzw/view?usp=sharing).

All the content is based on markdown files and jupyter notebooks rendered into a navegable book website using [jupyter-book](https://jupyterbook.org/intro.html). This site is called "The Enclosure Projects" because we have begun work on related papers and extensions that build upon the same framework.  Stay tuned.
