# The Enclosure Project


This is a jupyter book of the content of a couple of related ongoing projects on property rights 'enclosure' and the transformation of customary tenure.  We are writing this up as papers in Baker and Conning {cite}`baker2020`

All the content is based on markdown files and jupyter notebooks[^footn] combined together into a navegable book using [jupyter-book](https://jupyterbook.org/intro.html) which in turn builds on [Sphinx](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/).
